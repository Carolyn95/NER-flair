Dumps all bak data here
Recording a series of horrible mistakes I have made to warn myself and to avoid next time. 
Mistakes I have made: 
* take `O` as `0`, resulting in unexpected results
* use `make_tag_dictionary` not `make_label_dictionary` 
above two items are not technically my mistakes but I didn't pay attention and didn't solve them in advance then they become my mistakes

Architecture design errors:
* control varients, my testing set is not fixed, so the result is not comparable
* overlaps in my testing set and training set

Things I need to keep in mind:
* principle of machine learning is to **always keep the testing set unseen**
* how to transfer knowledge
